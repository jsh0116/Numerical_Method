## LU decomposition & Image Alignment
### Intro
One of the methods to solve the linear algebraic equation is to implement image alignment in LU Decomposition and Computer Vision, and to convert 2D points using Transformation Matrix in Linear System using MATLAB.

### Problem
#### 1. Implement LU_decomposition Algorithm

#### 2. Implement a function that computes a 3x3 transformation matrix T that converts 2D points pA to pB. When the coordinates of pA are (x1, y1) and the coordinates of pB are (x2, y2), the transformation relation equation through transformation matrix T is as follows.
